# Security Escort Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- **Fields Added to `trips` table:**

  - `has_security_escort` (BOOLEAN) - Whether trip requires security escort
  - `escort_count` (INTEGER) - Number of escort vehicles needed (max 2)
  - `escort_vehicle_ids` (JSONB) - Array of assigned escort vehicle IDs
  - `escort_status` (TEXT) - Assignment status: not_assigned, partially_assigned, fully_assigned
  - `escort_assigned_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When escorts were assigned

- **Migration Files:**
  - `20250103_add_security_escort_fields.sql` - Basic escort fields
  - `20250103_add_escort_vehicles_fields.sql` - Assignment tracking fields

### 2. TypeScript Types

- **Updated interfaces in:**
  - `src/lib/types/trip/trip-data.ts` - DbTrip, Trip, DisplayTrip interfaces
  - `src/lib/types/trip/trip-utils.ts` - Mapping function includes escort fields
  - `src/components/trips/types.ts` - Form types include escort fields

### 3. Trip Booking Form

- **Security Escort Toggle Component:** `src/components/trips/form/SecurityEscortToggle.tsx`
  - On/off switch for security escorts
  - Dropdown to select escort count (1-2)
  - Integrated into `TripForm.tsx`
  - State management and form submission included

### 4. Dispatch Interface

- **Security Escort Display:** Enhanced `DispatchTrips.tsx` component

  - Shows security escort requirements prominently
  - Color-coded status badges (not assigned, partial, fully assigned)
  - Lists assigned escort vehicles with details
  - Warning messages for unassigned escorts

- **Escort Assignment Dialog:** `AssignEscortDialog.tsx`
  - Modal for assigning escort vehicles
  - Filters available vehicles (excludes main trip vehicle and already assigned escorts)
  - Updates trip and vehicle status on assignment
  - Comprehensive error handling and validation

### 5. Data Flow

- **useTripsData Hook:** Updated to fetch escort fields
- **Mapping Functions:** Include escort data transformation
- **Real-time Updates:** Query invalidation for live updates

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Database Migrations Not Applied

**Symptoms:** Security escort fields don't exist in database
**Solution:** Run the SQL fix script:

```bash
# Apply the comprehensive fix
psql "your-database-url" -f SECURITY_ESCORT_FIX.sql
```

### Issue 2: No Test Data

**Symptoms:** No trips with security escort requirements visible
**Solution:** The fix script creates test data automatically, or create manually via trip booking form

### Issue 3: Vehicle Status Filter

**Symptoms:** No vehicles available for escort assignment
**Solution:** Update vehicle query to include both 'active' and 'available' status

### Issue 4: Console Errors

**Symptoms:** JavaScript errors in browser console
**Solution:** Check browser dev tools for specific errors

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Database Schema

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'trips'
AND column_name LIKE '%escort%';
```

### 2. Check for Security Escort Trips

```sql
SELECT id, has_security_escort, escort_count, escort_status
FROM trips
WHERE has_security_escort = true;
```

### 3. Browser Console Debugging

Open dispatch page and check console for:

- DispatchTrips debug logs showing escort trip counts
- AssignEscortDialog logs when clicking "Assign Escorts"
- Any JavaScript errors

### 4. Test Data Creation

Run the fix script `SECURITY_ESCORT_FIX.sql` which creates:

- 2 test trips with security escort requirements
- 4 test vehicles (1 main + 3 escort vehicles)
- 2 test drivers
- 1 test client

## üöÄ Quick Fix Instructions

1. **Apply Database Fix:**

   ```bash
   # Run the comprehensive fix script
   psql "your-database-connection-string" -f SECURITY_ESCORT_FIX.sql
   ```

2. **Restart Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to Dispatch Page:**

   - You should see test trips with security escort requirements
   - Red security escort sections should be visible
   - "Assign Escorts" buttons should appear

4. **Test Escort Assignment:**
   - Click "Assign Escorts" on a security trip
   - Dialog should open with available vehicles
   - Assign escorts and verify status updates

## üìã Feature Verification Checklist

- [ ] Trip booking form shows security escort toggle
- [ ] Can create trips with security escort requirements
- [ ] Dispatch page shows security escort requirements prominently
- [ ] "Assign Escorts" button appears for security trips
- [ ] Escort assignment dialog opens and functions

- [ ] Assigned escort vehicles are displayed with details
- [ ] Vehicle availability updates when escorts are assigned

## üîß Manual Testing Script

For browser console testing, you can use the debug functions in `DEBUG_SECURITY_ESCORT.js`:

```javascript
// Check existing security escort trips
checkSecurityEscortTrips();

// Create test security escort trip
createTestSecurityEscortTrip();
```

## üìù Notes

- Maximum 2 escort vehicles per trip (business requirement)
- Escort vehicles cannot be the same as the main trip vehicle
- Vehicle availability is tracked but vehicle updates are commented out pending database migration
- All security escort trips are prominently displayed with red warning styling
- Dispatch center has full control over escort assignments (not done in trip booking form)
